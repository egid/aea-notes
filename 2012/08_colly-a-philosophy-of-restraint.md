#A philosophy of restraint
â€” Simon Collison (@colly)

##Design is messy.

* the more we know about the user, the more we can make the site behave like it's been designed *for them*.

##We don't design web pages. We design systems.

* what we build is _rarely finished_.
	* BBC GEL (Global Experience Language)
* design responses first, not a website.
* "The simpler something is, the more usable... right?"
* not all data belongs on the same timeline.
	* some information is rapidly updated, which would cause the slow data to get lost.
	* `||||FAST||||    ||SLOW||`
* on stripping things out:
	* "It's just as likely that less... merely leads to less."
* don't underestimate humans; they'll fill in the blanks.

###Don't disguise calls to action!
* **Design with context.**
###Don't compromise primary areas

* add breathing space to the schedule
* audit regularly
