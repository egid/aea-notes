#Mobile to the Future
â€”Luke Wroblewski (@lukew)

* We think of mobile as "another screen to design on". It's not: it's **mass media**
* 50% of the personal computing devices sold today are Apple or Android.
* 82% of users forget their passwords (at least once).
* **mobile must never be dumbed down**
	* don't remove critical features
* masking a password doesn't help security.

##Mobile is a magnifying lens for design.

* where are the users having issues?
	* use input masks
	* save passwords
	* condense fields
		* [first] 
		* [middle]
		* [last]
	* could be
		* [full name]

##Keep people on the keys.
