# The future is now
—Eric Meyer (@ericmeyer)

Overall, this talk brought up little to no new information, but Meyer had a few interesting points.

* applying styles to inputs makes opera reset OS chrome to Windows
* `text-shadow` is **now unprefixed**
* opera doesn't redraw `box-shadow` on container resize! (seriously?)
* a linear gradient is actually a browser-generated image
* gradient direction: fucked up
	* right: 0°
	* bottom: 270°
	* etc
	* runs counterclockwise
* `background-size` impacts gradients
	* `background-repeat: no-repeat;`
* `-webkit-font-smoothing: antialiased;`
* `text-rendering: optimizeLegibility;`
