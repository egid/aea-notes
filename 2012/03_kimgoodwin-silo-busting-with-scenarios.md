# Silo-busting with Scenarios

* scenarios examine a user's entire experience from end to end
	* plausible story of how the site will be used
* user stories, specs, or use cases are not compelling or exciting for dev team
	* they can be useful, so use them if needed

## storytelling is human communication
* early in the design process we don't need detail
* we are particularly attuned to stories: they connect on an emotional level
* if we tell the right story, we can connect with the decisionmakers' gut

## humans are not system components
* try personas or real users
	* more nuanced version of a role
	* set of skills
	* context
	* also capture functional nuance. what does this person do or need?
## **silos = worse ux**
* if there is an opportunity for improvement, it's probably bceause users are falling between the cracks.
* is it because the two teams working on one product aren't talking to each other?
* what do you do if there are two silos that apply to one scenario? you **guess**.
	* "my system won't let me do that"
* user stories are tightly focused
	* "i want to log in so i can check my balance"

## sample: United.com

* merger with Continental = shitty results
* create personas:
	* each needs 1+ scenarios
	* for this one person, how do we solve their problem?
* Karen, a frequent flier
	* short & simple trips as well as occasional long & complex trips
	* books on united.com
	* cares about schedule & decent seats
	* sometimes upgrades with miles
	* premier platinum, almost next level
	* packs rolling bag & laptop
	* works & relaxes on flights - "weird flying office"
	* goals
		* avoid checking bags
		* maximize perks
		* focus on work or relaxation
* determine scenarios:
	* round trips
	* layovers
	* complex itineraries
	* upgrading with miles
	* buying tickets with miles
	* delayed flights
* identify things you can fix
	* frustration
	* uncertainty
	* anxiety
	* forcing the user to work
* sometimes we use the word usability too much:
	* "When was the last time you told a friend, 'you really should try this restaurant. It's really *edible*.'"
	* usability is *expected*. we need to add something *unexpectedly good*.
* you can act like a human without pretending to be one
	* if technology acts like a human and *fails to be one*, it's somehow more infuriating.
	* instead of dealing with a computer, you're dealing with an *idiot*.
	* based on scenarios, offer next steps
* yes, this is way bigger than your site.
	* it's easy to start the conversation

## sell the story

* "we can't do that" / "another team owns that" / etc.
	* not always 100% true.
	* translation: "we put our resources somewhere else".
* reframe the discussion:
	* would this be awesome? / why not?
	* how would we overcome this?
	* what would it take?
	* is it worth it?

## scope down

* get pragmatic
* add detail to the stories
* rough storyboard per scenario
	* start searching for commonalities
	* merge if they are compatible
* scenarios drive site structure
	* common tasks on homepage
	* branching format for variations
	* eliminates silos through crossover
* build a roadmap
* scope down to execution
* shouldn't take longer than a sprint or so.

## end results

* bring information forward based on persona
	* evaluate results to make sure that overlap isn't a problem
	* clarify information
* determine visual hierarchy
