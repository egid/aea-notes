# Content First

* even better would be "click here to read more"!
* schizophrenic content on many sites
	* rarely do sites plan for contingencies
	* 'schizophrenicopy'

## content is a design problem

* everyone is a designer of *experiences*.
* users are coming for content.
* they will rebuild content into what they want
	* instapaper
	* readability

## designers may no longer control the user experience

* "better design" can make content useless
* we think like print designers

## consensual hallucination

* we pretend we're writing for 1 thing
* what is the designer's job?
	* to serve the customer

## dark patterns happen when you _ignore the user_

* "he'll probably click the animated red devil-penis on the green background".

## **Design that does not serve people does not serve business.**

* good design starts with content.

## Serving the public means good experience for *everyone*

* mobile first = content first
* if i could only put three things on this screen, what are they?
* the user now knows to expect a different experience on different devices
	* facebook is always facebook
	* but it looks different on each device
* if the user expects that, we are now free.
