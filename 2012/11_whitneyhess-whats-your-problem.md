#What's your problem?
â€”Whitney Hess @whitneyhess

* best practices are not always good for our users.
* what is the right thing to build? should be the first question
	* problem **setting** before problem *solving*
	* Remember: "I'm not making products for me."
* define the product first
	* agreement
	* focus
	* quality
	* ease
	* (project goals (strategic user experience) user needs)
* set goals & metrics ([http://kpilibrary.com](kpi library))
* market research _is not user research_
* map interview results to:
	* background
	* attitude
	* behaviors
	* motivations
	* frustrations
	* tech use
* and use that to create personas.
