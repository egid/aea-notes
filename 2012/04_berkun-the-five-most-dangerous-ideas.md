# The Five Most Dangerous Ideas

## 1. Everyone is a designer

* what can design do for the world?
* "my client thinks he's a designer"
	* he *is* a designer. he's just an extremely **bad** one.

## 2. You have no power

* if you only have the low ground, fortifying buys you **nothing**.
* whoever uses the most jargon has the least confidence in their ideas.

## 3. The generalists are in charge.

* if there are more than 5 people in the room, you have less power than you think.
* great ideas *do not sell themselves*.
	* the scarier the idea, the more negative the feedback.
* in-room power vs out-of-room power
	* pre-pitch your ideas

## 4. You work in sales.

* Talk to people you don't like
* **If people think you are smart and useful your job title is irrelevant.**

## 5. Creativity is risk.

* "I'll just do the safer stuff. And complain about it."
