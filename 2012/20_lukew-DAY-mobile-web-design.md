#Mobile Web Design
â€”Luke Wroblewski @lukew

##Mobile strategy
* Mobile is going to happen to you, whether you like it or not.
	* 40% of Yelp searches are from 8% of their users
	* it's not about making desktop fit. it's about making information useful on the go.
	* 55% of twitter users are on mobile.
		* 40% of creation done on mobile
		* 15% of new accounds made on mobile
	* Facebook is over 50% mobile users
		* of those users, half of them are using the web app.
		* the other half is _all_ of the available native apps.
	* ~7 apps per phone get daily use
	* ~27 websites viewed per phone per day
* Use native for high value customers or features
	* make the app extras a web view that could also be viewed without the app.

All channels should support each other.
