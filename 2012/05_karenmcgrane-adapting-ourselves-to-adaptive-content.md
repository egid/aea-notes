# Adapting Ourselves to Adaptive Content

* create once, publish everywhere
* create -> api -> publishes to xml -> **platform determines format**
* content needs:
	* multiple sizes or versions
	* meaningful metadata
	* written for reuse
* **don't bury the lede**
* TRUNCATION IS NOT A CONTENT STRATE...
* if people are happy with their CMS, they will produce more and better content.
* **use mobile as a wedge**
	* change the way we write and create
* design with and for structured content
