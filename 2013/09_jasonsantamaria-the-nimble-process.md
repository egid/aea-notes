# The Nimble Process
[@jasonsantamaria](http://twitter.com/jasonsantamaria)

* No single path -- project, team, context
* Be flexible
* Old: agency model
	* Plan → Design → Code → Launch
* Design process is all about *communication*
	* MVU: Minimum Viable Understanding
	* Design is a language - tell a story.
* Starting out
	* **No details** – blurry photo gets sharpened as the process goes on
	* **No Grids** (until later)
	* Pencil & paper: easy, flexible, low expectations
		* Low detail opens the process to others
	* Ideas *want to be ugly*.
	* Work **backwards** into a grid
	* Content first
		* **type** first?
	* Sketch → code (if appropriate)

* **It's easier to revise** than **create**.
	* Shitty first drafts.
