# Designing for Touch
[@globalmoxie](http://twitter.com/globalmoxie)

* we've been doing it wrong!
	* there are multiple displays...
	* ...and multiple **inputs!**
	* mouse, text, voice, touch
* 31% of US adults own a tablet (pew internet)
* how pixels *feel* is important
	* when designing for mobile, we're no longer just doing UI - it's also industrial design
* phone grip study of 1300 users
	* [images]
	* 1 hand / 1 thumb: 49%
	* cradled / 1 hold, 1 pointer: 36%
	* two hands / 2 hold, 2 thumb: 15%
	* this is obviously context dependent
* some redux of lukew mobile web design
* place controls below content
* avoid permanent controls anywhere on mobile
	* think page bottom, not screen bottom
* tablet controls more appropriate to top corners
* screen size != touch
* CSS4 `@media (pointer: coarse)` will possibly allow us to target touch
* **simple != simplistic**
	* conversational interface, not a lecture
	* progressive disclosure
