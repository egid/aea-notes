* How can we apply our skills to leave customers feeling good about our brand?
* Great brans tell a story.
* Dissonance between brand & quality
	* BP's brand: Beyond Petroleum; Deepwater Horizon
	* Vitamin Water's brand: healthy alternative; basically soda
	* Bank of America's brand: American values; shitty shitty shitty.

> Good design is honest. – Dieter Rams

* Human presence doesn't have to be blatant and obvious.
* Personality is **essential**.
	1. **Your product stands out.** See: Dropbox, Hipmunk, Mailchimp.
	2. **Emption and memory are clearly linked.** See: GE advertisements.
	3. **Personality helps you find your tribe.** If you design for everyone, you design for no one.
	4. **Passion is contagious.**
* Who are **we**?
	* Make your design have a persona

* **What story are you telling?**
