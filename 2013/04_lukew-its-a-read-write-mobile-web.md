[@lukew](http://twitter.com/lukew)

* the most-active sites on internet are read/write
	* they don't function *at all* unless the user inputs something
* 23% growth in mobile-only facebook users... **in 3 months**
* ebay: $4b mobile sales in 2011 -> **$13b in 2012**
* 43% games, 26% social; mobile use is ~80% entertainment, and that number is decreasing
* [image: pyramid of users. flip it!]
* your design decisions should **make creation easy**

## prioritize for creation
1. one-handed use assumptions & suggestions
	* one thumb, one eyeball
	* time your users' interactions!
	* assume there will be distractions
	* don't let the keyboard come up!
		* Offer valid suggestions.
		* smart defaults
		* see: google flight search
2. Be visually engaging. 
	* images rule on mobile
		* see: hotel tonight gallery
	* compressive images
3. Focused flows
	* strip out needless steps
	* keep thinking about a problem until you've found the simplest solution
	* can be incredibly hard to drop existing concepts
4. Just-in-time actions
	* teach as people use
	* no intro -tours- tests
	* bring up ui & tips only when relevant
6. Cross-device usage
	* access - can reach via multiple devices
		* chrome sync
		* kindle
	* flow - can proceed to next step 
		* google docs
		* google maps
		* eBay
	* control - pass info to a paired system
		* oneID
	* push - send tasks to a phone
