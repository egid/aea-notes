[@uie](http://twitter.com/uie)

* Design is **the rendering of intent**.

	intention: |-------------------------------------------|
		   imitation								   innovation
		   - less expensive							   - design valued,
		   - less risky							       considered competitive
	payoff:    $			$$			$$$				$$$$

* Design is not *just* the visuals -- it's also the *business*.
* Innovation is not invention -- it is the addition of *new value*.
* Experience design is the rendering of **intent in the gaps**.
* The best designers...
	* are storytellers
	* can critique well
	* sketch & collaborate fluently
	* present their work
	* facilitate discussion
* Specialization **is a luxury**.
	* generalist: competent in most areas.
	* specialist: competent in most areas, expert in one or two.
	* *compartmentalist*: one area only; nobody can afford a compartmentalist.
* ***Hire generalists.***
